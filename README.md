This project is an AI-powered system that predicts a person's age just by looking at their face! It uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze facial features and estimate the age of the person in the image.

📌 Features
Predicts age from a single facial image

Uses machine learning / deep learning models for accurate predictions

Built with Python and OpenCV (or your specific tools)

Simple and easy-to-use interface

Can be used for real-time webcam detection or image uploads

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

Machine Learning (e.g., Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras)

NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib

Pre-trained models (like CNN or VGGFace, if used)
